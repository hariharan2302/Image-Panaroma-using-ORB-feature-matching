# Image-Panaroma-using-ORB-feature-matching
This project stitches multiple images into a panoramic photo. The images may be non-overlapping or multiply overlapped. The output image will be irregular as cropping is not allowed. The code must handle four or more images, with at least 20% overlap. Non-overlapping images can be ignored. Basic 2D planar transformations are sufficient.
